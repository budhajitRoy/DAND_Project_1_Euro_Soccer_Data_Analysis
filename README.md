# European Soccer Data Anaylsis

This is the second project that I have submitted as a part of my Udacity DAND course curriculum.

As a Soccer fan, I have decided to analyse European Soccer Database (from seasons 2008 to 2016 ). Following are the questions that I have come up for analysis. I divided the questions or research analysis set into two groups, one related to Players and one to Teams:

## On Players:

- Which player has the most penalties?
- Attributes of better players than average?
- Age and Overall Rating relationship analysis.
## On Teams:

- Which team improved the most over the time period?
- Home and Away Games - winning and losing ratio analysis.

## Resources:
